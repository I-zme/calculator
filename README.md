# calculator
Calculator for the Odin Project


Calculator for basic math. 
- can move with arrow keys, plus shortcuts for clear and backspace.
- does not crash when divide by zero
- cannot calculate above a certain size

issues:
- cannot press numbers to enter them.
- result can reach NaN under certain conditions, most have been solved but can still happen.
-when reaching a number larger than 9 digits, result will display in scientific BUT the calculation ends there, cannot continue from this to not crash the game.
